## About The Project

I always wanted to build something that can be usefull for a community. First community i am in from my birth is muslim ! What a great opportunity for me to build something that can bring me peace and satisfaction and also be usefull for other people.

I wanted to create something that can provide you prayer time for any location. A lot of actors do the same today, but i wanted something tghat can be more like an hybrid app. Have it as a web app, website, desktop app, in the same way thats good for me !

Nothing to bother the customer, no advertissement, just free service.

This will be the server support behind the possible application or web site that can come later.
